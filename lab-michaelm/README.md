# Resources
* [fs-extra](https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra)

# Directions
* make these directories to organize your code
  * lib
  * test
  * model
  * route
  * data // to hold your JSON files


* refactory your previous lab to 
  * pull your routes into a seporate module
  * In the router add `res.send`, `res.sendStatus`, and `res.json` to the response objects, before they are passed into a route handler
  * create a constructor to module your resouce and put it in your model directory
  * create a storage module that will persist you data to the file system

## Bonus
* **2pts** - have the **storage** module check for the type sub-directory, and create it if it does not exist
