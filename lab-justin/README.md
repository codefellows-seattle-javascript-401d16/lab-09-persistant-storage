# Feelings 2

In this project I created a RESTful API that allows you to create, read, update, and destroy data. That date being a name, an age, and a feeling of the day. A post, get, put, and delete route constructors are created/managed in router.js. Those routes allow us to apply CRUD operations to our simple resource object that has name, age, and feeling as properties. All tests past for this project.

This is similar to my last project, just added some different functionality such as a Class, persistent storage, and promises.
