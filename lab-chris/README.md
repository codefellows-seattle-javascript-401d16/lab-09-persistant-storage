## Description
401 JS -- lab 08 single resource API

Started with basically taking the demo code and making sure everything was set up properly. Added tests for all the routes and methods. Got the put method coded in and after some tinkering got the put tests to pass. Got the delete method down and got the tests to pass. Now that I know everything works with what Duncan had its time to break everything and add my constructor and change the routes. Everything is changed but most of my tests are failing. After much frustration I finally got everything to pass.
